# Credit Card Approval Predictions

![Credit Card](images/credit-card.jpg)

## Context
Credit score cards use personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants , that allow banks to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings . It is a common risk control method in the financial industry that complements the decision process on whether to issue a credit card on an applicant or not. Simply put credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk . 
 
At present, with the development of machine learning algorithms. More predictive methods such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. However, these methods often do not have good transparency. It may be difficult to provide customers and regulators with a reason for rejection or acceptance , so the models must be used as a supplement on the evaluation of the application and not simply as a yes or no mechanism.

## Project Objective

Build a classification machine learning model to predict if an application for the issuance of a credit card should be accepted or not , based on the clients historical data labeling him as a good or bad client.
